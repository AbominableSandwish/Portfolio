LevelUp Game Jam: 10th Anniversary

<b>Project Summary</b>

Team: 3 programmers from SAE Institute
Theme: Reduction, Reuse, Recycling
Secondary Constraints: Asynchronous multiplayer, Non-Euclidean
Final Choice: Solo shooter in a synthwave 80s atmosphere
Objective: Functional prototype to compete with teams of 5

<b>Roles and Contributions</b>

    Tech Art and Gameplay Programmer

- Created menus (main, score, about) and user interfaces
- Integrated audio system (music, sound effects, interface sounds)
- Implemented enemy damage and death animations
- Developed camera screenshake behavior
- Designed smoke, spark, and bullet particles

<b>Personal Experience</b>

- Stimulating collaboration: A positive change after solo work
- Increased motivation: Quick response to colleagues' requests and observation of the game coming to life
- Lack of time: Insufficient balancing for optimal experience
- Lesson learned: Prioritize balancing after creating a functional prototype

<b>Strengths</b>

Adherence to the main theme: Reduction, Reuse, Recycling
Functional prototype: Gameplay, menus, sounds, visual effects
Successful atmosphere: Immersive 80s synthwave

<b>Areas for Improvement</b>

Gameplay balancing: Long-term difficulty
Better use of constraints: Asynchronous multiplayer and non-Euclidean

<b>Conclusion</b>

Despite the lack of time to polish certain aspects, the LevelUp Game Jam project was an enriching experience. Team collaboration and the creation of a functional prototype were sources of motivation and satisfaction. The importance of balancing was also highlighted for an optimal gaming experience.

<b>Additional Information</b>

The project was made during the 10th anniversary of the LevelUp Game Jam.
The team decided to focus on the theme and create a shooter in a synthwave 80s atmosphere.
The main programmer worked on the gameplay mechanics, while the tech art and gameplay programmer focused on the feedback, audio, and visual effects.
The team learned the importance of balancing the gameplay after creating a functional prototype.

<b>Recommendations</b>

Teams should consider balancing the gameplay as early as possible.
Teams should try to use all of the constraints given in the game jam.
Teams should focus on creating a fun and engaging experience for the players.

<b>Thank you!</b>
