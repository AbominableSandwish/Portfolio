<h3 class="post-title">Project Summary</h3>

The students propose to organize a game jam at SAE. The event would provide a dedicated space for the competition and would be aligned with the Ludum Dare. This would provide all the necessary conditions for students to produce prototypes for this famous jam. The goal of the event is to evaluate and discover other media, as well as to assess the students' level within the independent industry.
A 48-hour competition within Sae is part of a 72-hour global competition. Once our competition is over, teams have an additional 24 hours to refine their work for the external competition! My role involves game mechanics, feedback, and integration into the audio bank with my audio system.

- Game Jam: Ludum Dare Sae
- Theme: Summoning
- Team: 3 programmers, 2 game artists & 1 Audio Desiger
- Genre:
- Rule: Survive as long as possible

<h3 class="post-title">Personal Experience</h3>

As the most experienced member of my team, I was quickly given the role of managing the entire production process. This included overseeing the various stages, from researching the overall game design to breaking down the tasks required to create all the necessary systems and prioritizing them. I also assembled all the mechanics, fixed all the bugs, and finalized as much feedback as possible. I was thrilled to be able to take the lead on a project and see it through to completion. I learned a lot about manipulating the various audio settings in Unity to better modulate the sound feedback in a game. This helped me improve the overall sound experience of the game.

<b>Thank you!</b>

Game rules:

There are two parameters to take into account:

Your reputation, which will be linked to the grievances of your people, and your speed of reaction, because if the queue gets too big, you risk getting stuck in it. You risk losing the Kingâ€™s favour. Good luck to you!
