<h3 class="post-title">Difficulties Encountered</h3>

This was the team's first project lasting several months. There was poor management of the game's progress, and the roles of product owner and producer were not yet clearly defined in the development process. In addition to monitoring the project's progress and deadline, the team had to work extra hard towards the end to create a functional project that could be submitted to the online distribution platform Steam.

<h3 class="post-title">Personal Experience</h3>

One Piu Day was a project developed during the second year at SAE Institute. It was an external project organized by the school's staff to bring together students from all game development programs into 9 teams. The teams competed in terms of production and management. Over time, only the 3 best projects could continue, while the other teams were disbanded and their members were absorbed by the surviving teams to further polish their projects. This was a wonderful experience that allowed students to collaborate and break the ice between different sections.

<b>Thank you!</b>
