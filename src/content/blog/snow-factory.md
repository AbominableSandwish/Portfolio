<h3 class="post-title">Personal Experience</h3>

We were able to produce the game in record time! from day one, it was up and running because the team's coordination was simply perfect.
we assembled each part of the system with perfect timing. even though we were able to fine-tune the game, there was unfortunately one event in the game that spoiled the experience (nuclear explosion, eliminating all the slaves/employees in your company) which meant we had to start the game from the beginning again. we avoided adding events that destroyed the player's investment in our game.

<b>Thank you!</b>
