<h3 class="post-title">Roles and Contributions</h3>

<b>Gameplay Programming</b>

- Added destructible walls when a player is ejected

- Added a fall system for the tornado
- Added a flashing effect that accelerates when an attack is charged
- Added a red flashing effect when a player is attacked

<b>Tech Art</b>

- Designed the different battle arenas
- Integrated the sprites
- Added the tornado (particle system) in the background
- Researched and added the sound bank (music, sound effects, UI sounds)

<h3 class="post-title">Personal Experience</h3>

The prototype was operational within the first 24 hours of the jam, which allowed us to fine-tune the gameplay as much as possible. Most of the participants were able to give us their feedback until the end of the competition, which was a strength compared to other teams. Despite the small size of our team, we were able to compensate with productivity and win first place. Personal lesson: finish a prototype early in order to balance and polish it as much as possible!

<b>Thank you!</b>
